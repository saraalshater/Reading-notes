# CSS Boxing 

The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use **pixels**, **percentages**, or
**ems**

- **Pixels** : pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.

- **Percentages**: the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window
or, if the box is encased within
another box, it is a percentage of
the size of the containing box.

- **ems** : the size
of the box is based on the size
of text within it. 

Designers
have recently started to use
**percentages** and **ems** more for
measurements as they try to
create designs that are flexible
across devices which have
different-sized screens.**


## Limiting width and Height
To ensure that the content of
pages are legible (especially on
the smaller screens of handheld
devices). You can use :

- **min-width** : This property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow. 

- **max-width** : This property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide.

- **min-height**

- **max-height**

## Overflowing content 

- **hidden**:
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.

`p { overflow: hidden; }`

- **scroll**: This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.

`p{ overflow: scroll; }`


## Border, Margin & Padding

**Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:**

- **Border** : Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another

- **Margin** : Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

- **Padding** : Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

***If you specify a width for a box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.***


## **Border width**

The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values:

`thin`

`medium`

`thick`

You can control the individual size of borders using four separate properties:

`border-top-width`

`border-right-width`

`border-bottom-width`

`border-left-width`

## Padding 
The padding property allows
you to specify how much space
should appear between the
content of an element and its
border.
The value of this property is
most often specified in **pixels**.

## Margin 
The margin property controls
the gap between boxes. Its value
is commonly given in **pixels**,
although you may also use
percentages or ems.




# Javascript
## ARRAY 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

## WHEN to use Array
- You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.

- Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold.

## How to create an array ?

`var color;

color = ['black', 'white','blue'];`  


- The values are assigned to the
array inside a pair of square
brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need
to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and
a Boolean all in the same array.

- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

- Each array has a property called
length, which holds the number
of items in the array.
