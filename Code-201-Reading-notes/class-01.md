## ***HTML Structure***
## HTML uses elements to describe the Structure of Pages
- Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
