# Forms

## Form Controls

There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site.


- ADDING TEXT
   - **Text input (single-line)** : Used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names.

   `<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />`

    

   - **Password input** : Like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.

   `<input type="text" name="username" size="15"maxlength="30" />`

   - **Text area (multi-line)** : For longer areas of text, such as messages and comments.

   `<textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">`

- Making Choices:
   - **Radio buttons** For use when a user must select **one** of a number of options.

   `<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" />`


   - **Checkboxes** When a user can select and unselect **one or more options**.

`<input type="checkbox" name="service"value="itunes" checked="checked" />`

   - **Drop-down boxes** When a user must pick one of a number of **options from a list**.


- Submitting Forms:
   - **Submit buttons** To submit data from your form to another web page.
   - **Image buttons** Similar to submit buttons but they allow you to use an image.

- Uploading Files:
  - **File upload** Allows users to upload files (e.g. images) to a website.
