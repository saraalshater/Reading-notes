# Operators
## **Assignment operators**
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

## **Destructuring**
For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

## **Comparison operators**

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 

## **Arithmetic operators**

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

## **Bitwise operators**
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.

## **Control flow**
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.


Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
