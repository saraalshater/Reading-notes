Serverless and Amplify
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.
A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.
Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity.
Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).
One of the major advantages of using Serverless is reduced cost
The downside is that Serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs.
To access these you must set up an API Gateway.
This doesn’t have an impact on your pricing or process, but it means you cannot directly access them through the usual IP.
Setting up different environments for Serverless is as easy as setting up a single environment.
With Serverless computing, there’s a hard 300-second timeout limit.
Scaling process for Serverless is automatic and seamless, but there is a lack of control or entire absence of control.
FaaS is an implementation of Serverless architectures where engineers can deploy an individual function or a piece of business logic.
With Serverless, everything is stateless, you can’t save a file to disk on one execution of your function and expect it to be there at the next.
FaaS are designed to spin up quickly, do their work and then shut down again.
With stateless functions multiple containers can be initialised, allowing as many functions to be run (in parallel, if necessary) as needed to continually service all incoming requests.
A Serverless solution consists of :
a web server
Lambda functions (FaaS)
security token service (STS)
user authentication
database.
AWS 
AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that can be used together or on their own, to help front-end web and mobile developers build scalable full stack applications, powered by AWS.
With Amplify, you can configure app backends and connect your app in minutes, deploy static web apps in a few clicks, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console.
Amplify supports popular web frameworks including JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, and mobile platforms including Android, iOS, React Native, Ionic, Flutter.
Benefits 
Configure backends fast
Seamlessly connect frontends
Deploy in a few clicks
Easily manage content
API (GRAPHQL)
The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS.
With the GraphQL Transform, you define your application’s data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.
