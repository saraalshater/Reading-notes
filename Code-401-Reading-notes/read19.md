# [Using WebSocket to build an interactive web application](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/)

### What is websocket ? 
The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
